# Rover VSCode Extension

**Rover** is a manager for AI coding agents that works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Qwen. It helps you get more done, faster, by allowing multiple agents to work on your codebase simultaneously.

This VSCode extension brings Rover's power directly to your editor. Run multiple coding agents in parallel on different tasks while you keep working. Everything runs locally in isolated environments, giving you full control over your development workflow.
