      You are analyzing a codebase to understand what needs to be documented.

      ---
      Title: 
      {{inputs.title}}

      Task description: 
      {{inputs.description}}

      Target audience: 
      {{inputs.audience}}
      ---

      Follow these steps to complete the analysis. Do not start the next phase until you complete the previous one.

      ### Phase 1: Identify the audience perspective

      Based on the target audience "{{inputs.audience}}", determine the documentation focus:

      - **Internal developers** (engineers working on the codebase):
        - Focus on: Class definitions, internal architecture, design patterns, code organization
        - Depth: Deep technical details, assumes familiarity with the codebase

      - **End-user developers** (external developers using the library/tool):
        - Focus on: Public APIs, CLI interfaces, library exports, integration guides
        - Depth: High-level interfaces, clear examples, assumes general programming knowledge

      - **Less technical users** (non-developers, beginners):
        - Focus on: Step-by-step guides, visual aids, simple tasks, troubleshooting
        - Depth: Simple language, minimal jargon, assumes little technical background

      ### Phase 2: Analyze the codebase

      Based on the audience focus identified above and the task description, explore the codebase to find relevant files:

      1. Identify what needs to be documented (feature, module, tool, API, etc.)
      2. Identify relevant source files, configuration files, and existing documentation
      3. Identify what are the key points the documentation must have. Be concise and keep them to the minimum, most relevant points. Organize the points by relevance.

      ### Phase 3: Output

      Write your structured analysis to `context.md` following this template. This is mandatory.

      Rules:
      - Use 1-line bullets wherever possible
      - Do not fabricate content; if information is unavailable or irrelevant, skip it
      - Focus on what's relevant for the target audience
      - Follow the template strictly

      <template>
      # Documentation Context

      ## Target Audience

      [1-2 sentences describing the audience and their needs]

      ## Documentation Scope

      [1 paragraph describing what needs to be documented]

      ### Out of the Scope

      [List with concise sentences the information that it's out of scope]

      ## Key points

      [Ordered list of key points to cover in the documentation, sorted by relevance. e.g:]
      - Install the CLI and authenticate the user
      - Initialize the project
      - Task definition
      - Create a task
      - Debugging

      ## Relevant Files

      ### Primary files
      - path/to/file:line-range: 1-line description of why this is relevant

      ### Supporting files
      - path/to/file: 1-line description (optional, only if needed)

      ## Key Concepts

      - concept name: 1-line explanation (only concepts the audience needs to understand)

      ## Dependencies & Prerequisites

      - dependency: why it matters for the documentation

      ## Relevant Existing Documentation

      - path/to/existing/docs: only point to documentation files that matches the target audience and are relevant for this documentation
      </template>
    outputs:
      - name: context_file
        description: 'Summary of the context analysis'
        type: file
        filename: context.md

  - id: outline
    type: agent
    name: 'Outline'
    prompt: |
      You are creating a detailed outline for technical documentation.

      ---
      Title:
      {{inputs.title}}

      Task description:
      {{inputs.description}}

      Target audience:
      {{inputs.audience}}

      Documentation format:
      {{inputs.format}}

      Context:
      {{steps.context.outputs.context_file}}
      ---

      Follow these steps to complete the outline. Do not start the next phase until you complete the previous one.

      ### Phase 1: Review the context

      Read the context analysis carefully to understand:
      - The target audience and their technical level
      - The documentation scope and what's out of scope
      - Key points to cover (sorted by relevance)
      - The documentation journey users will follow
      - Key concepts that need explanation
      - Dependencies and prerequisites

      ### Phase 2: Structure the documentation

      Based on the context, create a comprehensive outline that:

      1. Follows a logical progression
      2. Adapts the depth and style to the target audience. By default, be concise
      3. Avoid over explaning
      4. Ensures each section has a clear purpose and scope
      5. Uses appropriate headings hierarchy. Use the "Heading Level" property in the template
      6. When the target audience are not internal developers, skip any internal logic documentation

      For each section, consider:
      - What the user needs to know at this point
      - What they should have learned from previous sections

      ### Phase 3: Output

      Write your outline to `outline.md` following this template. This is mandatory.

      Rules:
      - Use clear, descriptive section titles
      - Include a sentence about what each section should cover
      - Follow the template strictly
      - Just output the template. Skip any text before and after

      Title:
      {{inputs.title}}

      Task description:
      {{inputs.description}}

      Target audience:
      {{inputs.audience}}

      Documentation format:
      {{inputs.format}}

      Context:
      {{steps.context.outputs.context_file}}

      Outline:
      {{steps.outline.outputs.outline_file}}
      ---

      Follow these steps to write the documentation. Do not start the next phase until you complete the previous one.

      ### Phase 1: Review preparation materials

      1. Review the context to understand the audience and scope
      2. Study the outline to understand the structure and flow
      3. Note which sections need code examples and visuals
      4. Identify key concepts that need clear explanation

      ### Phase 2: Apply documentation best practices

      You MUST follow these critical writing principles:

      **Clarity and Audience:**
      - State the purpose and audience in the first paragraph
      - Use simple, direct language appropriate for the target audience
      - Prefer active voice over passive voice
      - Define technical terms when first introduced
      - Avoid unnecessary jargon

      **Structure and Flow:**
      - Follow the outline structure
      - Lead with the main point in each section (Pyramid Principle)
      - Use short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
      - Create a logical narrative that guides the reader
      - Ensure each section is complete - incomplete information is worse than none

      **Code Examples:**
      - All code examples must be complete and ready to run
      - Include all necessary imports and setup
      - Follow the language's conventions and best practices
      - Ensure code inside blocks are properly indented
      - Add comments to explain complex parts
      - Use the right code block language identifier. For example, "jsonc" for JSON files with comments

      **Content Requirements:**
      - Start with a Quick Start section if appropriate
      - Explain the "why" before the "how"
      - Provide step-by-step instructions for tasks
      - Include troubleshooting for common issues. You do not need to cover all possible edge cases
      - Reference existing documentation where relevant

      **Formatting:**
      - Use proper heading hierarchy
      - Use bullet points for lists
      - Use numbered lists for sequential steps
      - Use code blocks with proper language tags
      - Use tables for comparing options or listing parameters
      - Use tables when describing CLI arguments, configuration properties, API properties, or similar information
      - Bold important terms and warnings

      ### Phase 3: Write the documentation

      Based on the outline and best practices, prepare the draft. Select the blocks that are relevant for each section:

      1. **Introduction**: State audience, purpose, and what readers will learn
      2. **Prerequisites**: List what users need before starting
      3. **Core Content**: Follow the outline, ensuring each section:
         - Has a clear purpose
         - Flows from previous sections
         - Includes relevant examples
         - Addresses the audience's technical level
      4. **Examples**: 1-2 examples. Create working code samples that:
         - Start simple and build complexity
         - Cover common use cases
         - Include error handling

      ### Phase 4: Output

      Write your documentation to `draft.md` following this structure. This is mandatory.

      Rules:
      - Follow the outline structure
      - Write complete, production-ready documentation
      - Include all code examples inline
      - Use proper {{inputs.format}} formatting
      - Include meta-comments like "[REQUIRED IMAGE]" when you consider it's relevant
      - Make the documentation self-contained and ready for users

      The documentation should:
      - Start with a clear title and introduction
      - Follow the sections defined in the outline
      - Include all necessary code examples
      - Be formatted in clean, readable {{inputs.format}}
      - Be appropriate for the target audience ({{inputs.audience}})
    outputs:
      - name: draft_file
        description: 'Initial document draft file'
        type: file
        filename: draft.md

  - id: review
    type: agent
    name: 'Review'
    prompt: |
      You are reviewing and finalizing technical documentation.

      ---
      Title:
      {{inputs.title}}

      Task description:
      {{inputs.description}}

      Target audience:
      {{inputs.audience}}

      Documentation format:
      {{inputs.format}}

      Context:
      {{steps.context.outputs.context_file}}

      Outline:
      {{steps.outline.outputs.outline_file}}

      Draft:
      {{steps.draft.outputs.draft_file}}
      ---

      Follow these steps to review and finalize the documentation. Do not start the next phase until you complete the previous one.

      ### Phase 1: Quality review

      Review the draft documentation against these criteria:

      **Content Completeness:**
      - Does it follow the outline structure?
      - Are all key points from the context addressed and grouped logically?

      **Audience Appropriateness:**
      - Is the language appropriate for {{inputs.audience}}?
      - Is the technical depth correct?

      **Readability:**
      - Is the formatting consistent and clean?
      - Is the document long or short? Is it easy to read?
      - Does it highlight important bits with bold text, without overusing it?

      ### Phase 2: Apply improvements

      Based on your review, improve the documentation:

      1. Fix any issues found
      2. Polish the content when required
         - Improve clarity, conciseness, and consistency
         - Fix grammar and spelling
      4. Ensure the document has a valid {{inputs.format}} format

      ### Phase 3: Create final documentation

      Write the final, polished documentation to `docs.md`. This is mandatory.

      The final document must:
      - Be complete and ready for publication
      - Include all improvements from the review
      - Follow all documentation best practices
      - Be properly formatted in {{inputs.format}}
      - Be appropriate for {{inputs.audience}}
      - Skip adding a table of content

      ### Phase 4: Create summary

      Write a summary of the documentation process to `summary.md`. This is mandatory.

      <template>
      # Documentation Summary

      ## What was documented

      [1-2 paragraphs describing what documentation was created and its purpose]

      ## Target audience

      [List all major sections]

      ## Related documentation

      [List any related docs that readers might find useful, or "None" if standalone]
      </template>
    outputs:
      - name: document_file
        description: 'Documentation file'
        type: file
        filename: docs.md
      - name: summary_file
