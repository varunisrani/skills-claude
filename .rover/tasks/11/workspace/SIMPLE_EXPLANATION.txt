                        SIMPLE EXPLANATION
================================================================================

You Asked: Why .NET SDK? What's it used for?

================================================================================
                        TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
================================================================================

THING 1: CLAUDE AGENT SDK
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What it is: Python library               │
│ What it does: Talks to Claude via API    │
│ Like: Texting someone                    │
│ .NET SDK needed: NO ✅                   │
│ Status: WORKING NOW ✅                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example:
  You: "Write Python code"
  Claude: "Here's code: def hello(): print('hi')"
  You: Copy the code and run it yourself

THING 2: OPENHANDS FRAMEWORK
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What it is: Automation framework         │
│ What it does: Claude EXECUTES code       │
│ Like: Hiring assistant to do work        │
│ .NET SDK needed: YES ⚠️                  │
│ Status: NEEDS .NET SDK SETUP ⚠️          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example:
  You: "Create a file called hello.py"
  OpenHands: Actually creates the file
  Claude: Executes code on your computer

================================================================================
                        WHY THE DIFFERENCE?
================================================================================

CLAUDE AGENT SDK:
  Your Computer
         ↑
         │
    Network (Internet)
         ↑
         │
    Claude API (Remote)
         
  Just sends/receives messages over internet
  No local execution
  No PowerShell needed
  No .NET SDK needed ✅
  Works NOW ✅

OPENHANDS:
  Your Computer (Local)
         ↑
    PowerShell (executes commands)
         ↑
    .NET SDK (required to run PowerShell)
    
  Actually executes code on your machine
  Uses PowerShell to run commands
  PowerShell requires .NET SDK
  Doesn't work without it ⚠️

================================================================================
                        WHAT DOES .NET SDK DO?
================================================================================

.NET SDK is a collection of software that includes:
  - PowerShell (command runner)
  - System libraries
  - Development tools

OpenHands uses it to:
  - Run commands on your computer
  - Execute Python scripts
  - Create files
  - Run system commands

Without .NET SDK:
  - PowerShell can't load properly
  - OpenHands can't execute commands
  - OpenHands fails ✗

But Claude Agent SDK:
  - Doesn't run commands
  - Doesn't need PowerShell
  - Doesn't need .NET SDK
  - Works fine ✅

================================================================================
                        YOUR SITUATION
================================================================================

RIGHT NOW:

  Claude Agent SDK: ✅ Working perfectly
  .NET SDK: ❌ Not installed (not needed)
  OpenHands: ⚠️ Needs .NET SDK to work

YOU CAN:

  Use Claude Agent SDK immediately ✅
    → No setup needed
    → Works right now
    → Start building today

YOU CAN'T (YET):

  Use OpenHands server on port 3000
    → Needs .NET SDK
    → Will work after installing .NET SDK
    → Still optional

================================================================================
                      WHICH SHOULD YOU USE?
================================================================================

QUESTION: Which is better?

ANSWER: They're for different things!

Claude Agent SDK is better for:
  ✅ Quick responses
  ✅ Learning
  ✅ Writing code
  ✅ Getting advice
  ✅ Right now (no setup)

OpenHands is better for:
  ✅ Full automation
  ✅ Complex tasks
  ✅ Real execution
  ✅ When you need it (after .NET setup)

================================================================================
                        WHAT TO DO NOW
================================================================================

STEP 1: Use Claude Agent SDK (NOW ✅)

  python test_sdk_direct.py
  
  This proves everything works.

STEP 2: Build something with Claude Agent SDK

  Read: QUICK_START_SDK.md
  Use: test_sdk_direct.py as reference

STEP 3: (Later, if you want it) Install .NET SDK

  Download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
  Time: ~10 minutes
  Why: To use OpenHands on port 3000
  Urgency: NOT NOW - Optional for later

================================================================================
                      DECISION FLOWCHART
================================================================================

Do you want to use Claude to talk and get responses?
  YES → Use Claude Agent SDK NOW ✅
  NO  → Skip to next question

Do you want Claude to automatically execute code?
  YES → You'll need OpenHands
         → Which needs .NET SDK
         → Install it (~10 min)
         → Then use it
  NO  → Use Claude Agent SDK ✅

Do you want to start immediately?
  YES → Use Claude Agent SDK NOW ✅
  NO  → Install .NET SDK first, then OpenHands

SIMPLIFIED: Use Claude Agent SDK now. Install .NET SDK later if needed.

================================================================================
                      YOUR QUICK ANSWER
================================================================================

Why .NET SDK?
  → OpenHands needs it to run commands on Windows

Does Claude Agent SDK need it?
  → NO ❌

Do you need it now?
  → NO ❌

Should you install it?
  → NO, not now ✅
  → Maybe later if you want OpenHands

What should you do now?
  → Use Claude Agent SDK
  → Run: python test_sdk_direct.py
  → Read: QUICK_START_SDK.md
  → Start building!

================================================================================

Bottom Line:
  Claude Agent SDK = Works now, no .NET SDK
  OpenHands = Optional, needs .NET SDK
  
  Use Claude Agent SDK RIGHT NOW! ✅
