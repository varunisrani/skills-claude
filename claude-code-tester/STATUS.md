## How It Works

1. **Define Tests** - Write test cases in natural language JSON
2. **Execute via Claude** - Claude Code interprets and runs tests
3. **Playwright Actions** - Browser automation via MCP
4. **Adaptive Decisions** - AI makes element selection decisions
5. **Validation** - Visual and functional validation
